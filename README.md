# Health

Enables reading and writing health data from/to Apple Health, Google Fit and Health Connect.

> Google Fitness API is being deprecated and Health Connect the plugin will transition into the API as the Health Connect

The plugin supports:

- handling permissions to access health data using the `hasPermissions`, `requestAuthorization`, `revokePermissions` methods.
- reading health data using the `getHealthDataFromTypes` method.
- writing health data using the `writeHealthData` method.
- writing workouts using the `writeWorkout` method.
- writing meals on iOS (Apple Health) & Android (Google Fit) using the `writeMeal` method.
- writing audiograms on iOS using the `writeAudiogram` method.
- writing blood pressure data using the `writeBloodPressure` method.
- accessing total step counts using the `getTotalStepsInInterval` method.
- cleaning up dublicate data points via the `removeDuplicates` method.
- removing data of a given type in a selected period of time using the `delete` method.
- Support the future Android API Health Connect.

Note that for Android, the target phone **needs** to have [Google Fit](https://www.google.com/fit/) or [Health Connect](https://health.google/health-connect-android/) (which is currently in beta) installed and have access to the internet, otherwise this plugin will not work.

## Data Types

| **Data Type**               | **Unit**                | **iOS** | **Android (Google Fit)** | **Android (Health Connect)** | **Comments**                           |

## Setup

### Apple Health (iOS)

Step 1: Append the Info.plist with the following 2 entries

```xml
<key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
<key>NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will sync your data with the Apple Health app to give you better insights</string>
```

Step 2: Open your Flutter project in Xcode by right clicking on the "ios" folder and selecting "Open in Xcode". Next, enable "HealthKit" by adding a capability inside the "Signing & Capabilities" tab of the Runner target's settings.

### Google Fit (Android option 1)

Follow the guide at https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-api-key

Below is an example of following the guide:

Change directory to your key-store directory (MacOS):
`cd ~/.android/`

Get your keystore SHA1 fingerprint:
`keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android`

Example output:

```
Alias name: androiddebugkey
Creation date: Jan 01, 2013
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Issuer: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Serial number: 4aa9b300
Valid from: Mon Jan 01 08:04:04 UTC 2013 until: Mon Jan 01 18:04:04 PST 2033
Certificate fingerprints:
     MD5:  AE:9F:95:D0:A6:86:89:BC:A8:70:BA:34:FF:6A:AC:F9
     SHA1: BB:0D:AC:74:D3:21:E1:43:07:71:9B:62:90:AF:A1:66:6E:44:5D:75
     Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA
     Version: 3
```

Follow the instructions at https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-api-key for setting up an OAuth2 Client ID for a Google project, and adding the SHA1 fingerprint to that OAuth2 credential.

The client id will look something like `YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com`.

### Health Connect (Android option 2)

Health Connect requires the following lines in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file (also seen in the example app):

```
<queries>
    <package android:name="com.google.android.apps.healthdata" />
        <intent>
            <action android:name="androidx.health.ACTION_SHOW_PERMISSIONS_RATIONALE" />
        </intent>
</queries>
```

### Android Permissions

Starting from API level 28 (Android 9.0) acessing some fitness data (e.g. Steps) requires a special permission.

To set it add the following line to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
```

#### Health Connect

If using Health Connect on Android it requires speciel permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
The permissions can be found here: https://developer.android.com/guide/health-and-fitness/health-connect/data-and-data-types/data-types

Example shown here (can also be found in the example app):

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.READ_HEART_RATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.health.WRITE_HEART_RATE"/>
```

#### Workout permissions

Additionally, for Workouts: If the distance of a workout is requested then the location permissions below are needed.

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

There's a `debug`, `main` and `profile` version which are chosen depending on how you start your app. In general, it's sufficient to add permission only to the `main` version.

Beacuse this is labled as a `dangerous` protection level, the permission system will not grant it automaticlly and it requires the user's action.
You can prompt the user for it using the [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) plugin.
Follow the plugin setup instructions and add the following line before requsting the data:

```
await Permission.activityRecognition.request();
await Permission.location.request();
```

### Android X

Replace the content of the `android/gradle.properties` file with the following lines:

```bash
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Usage

See the example app for detailed examples of how to use the Health API.

The Health plugin is used via the `HealthFactory` class using the different methods for handling permissions and getting and adding data to Apple Health / Google Fit.
Below is a simplified flow of how to use the plugin.

```dart
  // create a HealthFactory for use in the app, choose if HealthConnect should be used or not
  HealthFactory health = HealthFactory(useHealthConnectIfAvailable: true);

  // define the types to get
  var types = [
    HealthDataType.STEPS,
    HealthDataType.BLOOD_GLUCOSE,
  ];

  // requesting access to the data types before reading them
  bool requested = await health.requestAuthorization(types);

  var now = DateTime.now();

  // fetch health data from the last 24 hours

```

### Health Data

A `HealthDataPoint` object contains the following data fields:

```dart
HealthValue value; // NumericHealthValue, AudiogramHealthValue, WorkoutHealthValue, ElectrocardiogramHealthValue
HealthDataType type;
HealthDataUnit unit;
DateTime dateFrom;
DateTime dateTo;
PlatformType platform;
String uuid, deviceId;
String sourceId;
String sourceName;
```

A `HealthData` object can be serialized to JSON with the `toJson()` method.

### Fetch health data

See the example here on pub.dev, for a showcasing of how it's done.

NB for iOS: The device must be unlocked before Health data can be requested, otherwise an error will be thrown:

```
flutter: Health Plugin Error:
flutter: 	PlatformException(FlutterHealth, Results are null, Optional(Error Domain=com.apple.healthkit Code=6 "Protected health data is inaccessible" UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Protected health data is inaccessible}))
```

### Filtering out duplicates

If the same data is requested multiple times and saved in the same array duplicates will occur.

A single data point can be compared to each other with the == operator, i.e.

```dart
HealthDataPoint p1 = ...;
HealthDataPoint p2 = ...;
bool same = p1 == p2;
```

If you have a list of data points, duplicates can be removed with:

```dart
List<HealthDataPoint> points = ...;
points = Health.removeDuplicates(points);
```

## Workouts

As of 4.0.0 Health supports adding workouts to both iOS and Android.
